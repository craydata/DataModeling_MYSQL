# Telecom Service Provider Database & Employee Payroll Management System

This project is a combination of two essential systems: the Telecom Service Provider Database and the Employee Payroll Management System.


## Telecom Service Provider Database
The Telecom Service Provider Database is specifically designed to facilitate the management and tracking of services provided by a telecommunications company. It serves as a centralized repository for storing pertinent information related to customers, services, and billing.


## Features
- Customer Management: This database enables efficient storage and management of customer details, including their names, addresses, contact information, and billing preferences. It also maintains a comprehensive history of customer interactions and service subscriptions.
- Service Management: The system allows you to record various services offered by the telecom company, such as internet plans, phone plans, cable TV packages, and more. Each service is associated with relevant details, including pricing, data limits, call rates, and available channels.
- Billing and Invoicing: With this system, billing and invoicing processes become streamlined. It automatically generates invoices for customers based on their service subscriptions and keeps track of payments while providing an overview of outstanding balances.
- Complaints and Support: The database tracks customer complaints and support requests, facilitating prompt assistance and efficient issue resolution.


## Employee Payroll Management System
The Employee Payroll Management System is designed to simplify payroll processes within an organization. It automates salary calculations, tax deductions, and other crucial payroll-related tasks.


## Features
- Employee Management: The system efficiently stores employee details, such as names, addresses, contact information, and employment histories. It also maintains records of leaves, attendance, and performance, enabling effective employee management.
- Salary Calculation: The system automates salary calculations based on predefined salary structures, which include components like basic pay, allowances, and deductions. Factors such as attendance, leaves, and performance bonuses are taken into account to determine the final salary.
- Tax and Deductions: With this system, tax calculations, deductions, and other withholdings are handled seamlessly, ensuring compliance with local tax laws and regulations. It generates reports for tax filing purposes.
- Payroll Reports: The system generates various reports, including employee-wise salary statements, tax summaries, and payroll summaries. These reports provide a comprehensive overview of payroll-related information.

ERD Diagram
The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrates the relationships between different entities in the database. Below is the ERD diagram for the Telecom Service Provider Database and Employee Payroll Management System:
